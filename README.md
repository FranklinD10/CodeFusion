# CodeFusion

**CodeFusion** is a versatile web application that allows users to upload multiple code files (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, etc.), merge them into a single text file, and download the merged file. Each file's content is clearly marked with its filename at the beginning and end.

## Use Cases for CodeFusion

### 1. Project Documentation
Combine multiple code files into a single document for easier review and documentation. This is especially useful for creating comprehensive project reports or documentation.

### 2. Code Review
Merge code files to provide a consolidated view for code reviews. Reviewers can see all changes in one place, making it easier to provide feedback.

### 3. Backup and Archiving
Create a single text file containing all your code files for backup or archival purposes. This ensures that all your code is preserved in one place.

### 4. Educational Purposes
Teachers and students can use CodeFusion to merge code snippets from different lessons or assignments into one file for study or submission.

### 5. Code Sharing
Simplify the process of sharing code by merging multiple files into one. This is useful when sharing code snippets or examples with others.

### 6. Version Control
Use CodeFusion to create a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. This can be helpful for version control and tracking changes over time.

### 7. Debugging and Testing
Merge code files to create a single document for debugging or testing purposes. This can help in identifying issues across multiple files.

### 8. Collaboration
Teams working on different parts of a project can merge their code files to create a unified document, facilitating better collaboration and integration.

### 9. AI
Helpful when interactive with AI chatbots for assistance with coding projects.
